## google cred - needed for each computer

## 1. Google Cloud Platform > get .json key file from Google Cloud Platform
## 2. Download/save in repo folder
## IMPORTANT !!! :
## 3. ADD to .gitignore so it is NOT pushed up to GitHub repo 
##    - EASY: Git > select file > gear > ignore (automatically adds to .gitignore)
